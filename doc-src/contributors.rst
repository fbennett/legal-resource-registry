Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Court lists can be contributed or edited using the spreadsheet files
supplied under yellow-highlighted links in the LRR.  The instructions
below are meant to help you work with the lists in this form. For
large or complex jurisdictions, other methods of updating the LRR data
are available. Feel free to write to ``bennett@nagoya-u.jp`` if you
encounter issues that require further discussion.

Begin by reading the instructions in the yellow box. After reading,
you may wish to hide the box, so that it does not get in the way
while you are editing the form. To hide the box, click the **[-]**
button, in the margin to the left of the box.

Setting the main language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each court should be recorded in the language and script used in court
judgments and other official records in your jurisdiction.  The form
will initially show **English (en-US)** as the main language; for most
jurisdictions this will be incorrect. To set language to another
value, click on it, then click on the small arrow that appears to the
right of the field, as shown by the red arrow. Scroll to your desired
language and click on it. (If the correct language is not shown,
please let me know, so that I can add it to the list and send you a
revised version of the form.)

Revealing the alternative language column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your jurisdiction has two official languages, court names should be
recorded in both. To reveal the alternative language column, click on
the **[+]** in the top margin, shown by the red arrow.

Setting the alternative language

Setting the alternative language works in the same way as setting the
main language. The field will initially show **none**. To change the
setting, click on the field, then on the arrow icon to its left, as
shown by the red arrow, and select the desired language. The language
will appear in the headings down the alternative language column.
The "main" and "alternative" language settings do not imply priority;
if your jurisdiction treats two languages as having equal status, it
does not matter which is set to "main," but the language used in each
column should be consistent.

Correcting the language of entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For many jurisdictions, the initial entries will be written entirely
in English. The fields in the "main" and "alternative" language
columns should be revised to show the court names in the proper
language and script.
