Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Legal Resource Registry (LRR) is a repository of basic information
on court systems worldwide. The project has the following specific
objectives:

* To collect the names of all citable courts and tribunals (yes,
  everywhere): [#]_

    - in the official language (or languages) used locally; and
    - in English translation

* To assign a stable, unique identifier to each court listed
* To identify the reporting service (or services) to which judgments
  of each court or tribunal may be cited

Court identifiers are a fundamental building block for legal
information systems able to cope with an international
environment. Given the enthusiasm with which legal harmonization and
unification have been touted in recent years, it is a bit surprising
that these do not already exist; yet we can have them if we will.

The LRR should be seen as a complement to other, similar initiatives,
[#]_ which is distinguished by a fast, flexible collection process
|---| and one that does not depend on official action in each of the
180+ jurisdictions that such a project must cover. Any interested
researcher or legal professional can register or submit revisions to
the LRR lists for their jurisdiction. Through individual, needs-driven
contributions, we can cover the world somewhat more quickly, and
developers can take advantage of the result to build systems that
help us all in our work.

    Nagoya University

**United States**
    The LRR data for U.S. courts is the result of painstaking work by
    the developers of `CourtListener.com`__, a project of the
    non-profit `Free Law Project`__. The CourtListener data were
    the original inspiration for the LRR, and it has been designed
    to "put something back," by exporting current data in a form
    suitable for use in the CourtListener system.

**International Data**
    A large number of non-U.S. jurisdictions are shown in the top
    **Jurisdictions** page with a yellow-highlight. The spreadsheet
    reporting file linked to each is derived from court lists
    published on the `World Law Guide`__ website; this has been
    important seed data for worldwide extension of the LRR.

.. [#] In addition to court names, LRR records contain a note of the
       court's website URL, where they are available; but collecting
       website links is not a core objective of the project.
